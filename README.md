## Project Description
In a team of 5, we are working on a tutoring services system as part of a McGill University course (ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering).
Out of three possible viewpoints (Student, Tutor, and Company Manager), we have been assigned to the **Company Manager** viewpoint.
Our project will consist of 4 sprints, which are identified as milestones here on GitHub.
